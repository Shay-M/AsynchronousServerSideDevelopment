Logic Question
Passing the River Five people come to a river at night. There is a narrow bridge,
but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's
night, the torch must be used when crossing the bridge. 
Person A can cross the bridge in one minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, D in 8 minutes and E in 12
minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they move at the slower
person's pace. What is the minimum total time needed for the group to cross?
