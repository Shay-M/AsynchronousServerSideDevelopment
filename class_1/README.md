## Lines and Points Assignment

You should define the class Point. Each and every object we instantiate from Point should include two properties: x and y. You should define the class Line. Each and every object we instantiate from Line should include two properties: p1 and p2. Both p1 and p2 should hold a reference for a Point object. In addition, the class Line should include the definition for the parallel static method. It should be a function that takes two references for two Line objects, and returns true if both lines are parallel. In addition, the class Line should include the definitions for the slope and the toString functions.
