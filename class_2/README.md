##Array of Students

You should develop a new library that includes a function that takes an array of strings (each string describes a specific student, and each string includes - in this order - the id, name, and average - and the separator character is ,) and returns an array of objects instantiated from Student, a class you should define accordingly. You should use the map function (Array.prototype.map). If the structure of a specific string is not the expected, an exception should be thrown. The library should include the definition for a class that describes the exception.
